bio: |-
  Based in Lynchburg, John partners with Central Virginia founders who are preparing for liquidity events and want their capital to keep working long after the deal closes. He blends nearly two decades of institutional asset management experience with firsthand knowledge of owner-operator needs, helping clients translate a sale into disciplined investment policies, tax-aware distribution plans, and family governance frameworks. Recent engagements include guiding a multi-generation manufacturing family through an eight-figure recapitalization and establishing an evergreen portfolio that funds both growth ventures and philanthropic commitments.
